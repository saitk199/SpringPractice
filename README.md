# SpringPractice
Just Spring Practice

Training project for practicing Spring framework,
reviewing libraries, technologies and writing tests.

## Linked Libraries
### Spring
1) **Spring Web** (Build web, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC. Uses Apache Tomcat as the default embedded container.)
2) **Rest Repositories** (Exposing Spring Data repositories over REST via Spring Data REST.)
3) **Spring HATEOAS** (Eases the creation of RESTful APIs that follow the HATEOAS principle when working with Spring / Spring MVC.)
### Tools
1) **Lombok** (Java annotation library which helps to reduce boilerplate code.)
2) **Spring Configuration Processor** (Generate metadata for developers to offer contextual help and "code completion" when working with custom configuration keys (ex.application.properties/.yml files).)
### Tests
1) **Spring Test** (Starter for testing Spring Boot applications with libraries including JUnit Jupiter, Hamcrest and Mockit.)
